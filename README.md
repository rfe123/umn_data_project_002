UMN Data Bootcamp Project 2 - ETL

## Introduction

Matt Idle and Bob Erickson partnered to deliver Project 2 for UMN Data Analytics Bootcamp, covering Pandas and PostgreSQL

For the ETL mini project, you will work with a partner to practice building an ETL pipeline using Python, Pandas, and either Python dictionary methods or regular expressions to extract and transform the data. After you transform the data, you'll create four CSV files and use the CSV file data to create an ERD and a table schema. Finally, you’ll upload the CSV file data into a Postgres database.

## Instructions
The instructions for this mini project are divided into the following subsections:

- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames & Export to CSV
- Create the Campaign DataFrame & Export to CSV
- Create the Contacts DataFrame & Export to CSV
- Create the Crowdfunding Database (postgresql)
  - Use QuickDBD to generate an Entity Relationship Diagram and SQL Schema
  - Import the CSV above to relevant tables in PostgreSQL Database
  - Use SQL SELECT and JOIN to verify the constraints and imports were succesful
